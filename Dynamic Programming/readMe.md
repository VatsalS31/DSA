## Knapsack (3 Types)

- **Fractional Knapsack** (Greedy, not considered in DP)
- **0/1 Knapsack** (Take or not take, can't take a fraction, take unique elements)
- **Unbounded Knapsack** (Take or not take, can't take a fraction, can take already chosen elements again and again)

### 0/1 Knapsack and Problems Based on It

1. **0/1 Knapsack**
   - Recursive
   - Memoization
   - Tabulation
2. **Subset Sum Problem**
3. **Equal Sum Partition Problem**
4. **Count of Subset Sum with a Given Sum**
5. **Minimum Subset Sum Difference**
6. **Count the Number of Subsets with a Given Difference / Target Sum**

### Unbounded Knapsack and Problems Based on It

1. **Rod Cutting**
2. **Coin Change 1**
3. **Coin Change 2**
4. **Maximum Ribbon Cut**
